Gridster is a tool that provides a way to help you with solving complex character mazes, educate about pathfinding algorhitms and understand them better, or to just entertain yourself a bit with it&#39;s visuals. </p><h2 class="text-3xl">Mazes?</h2><p class="text-lg border bg-muted rounded border-orange-300 p-2"> The mazes we&#39;re talking about are essentially matrices containing characters, such as this one: </p><div class="grid items-center justify-center"><div><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>.</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>x</span></div><div><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>x</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>#</span></div><div><span>#</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>#</span><span>S</span><span>.</span><span>#</span><span>#</span></div><div><span>#</span><span>.</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>.</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span></div><div><span>#</span><span>.</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>.</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span></div><div><span>#</span><span>.</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>E</span><span>#</span><span>#</span></div><div><span>#</span><span>.</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span></div><div><span>#</span><span>.</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span></div><div><span>x</span><span>x</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span></div><div><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span><span>#</span></div></div><h1 class="text-3xl text-orange-300">Who is Gridster for?</h1><h2 class="text-2xl">Developers</h2><p class="text-lg bg-muted rounded shadow shadow-orange-300 p-2"> If u are a developer and u need to solve mazes in your applications, Gridster provides a REST API that can not only solve a Matrix for u, but also provide u with additional information, and letting u pick one of our pathfinding algoritms. </p><h2 class="text-2xl">Students and Enthusiasts</h2><p class="text-lg bg-muted rounded shadow shadow-orange-300 p-2"> If u are a IT student or just interested in pathfinding algorhitms, Gridster provides a way for u to build your own Matrix, pick a pathfinding algorhitm and see how it solves the Matrix for u. U can also see how the Matrix is searched and what the shortest path is, all with nice colorful animations that u can adjust. </p><h1 class="text-3xl text-orange-300">Why was Gridster created?</h1><p class="text-lg bg-muted rounded shadow shadow-orange-300 p-2"> Gridster was created as a School graduation project for SPŠE Ječná in my 4th year of study there. It&#39;s supposed to make Pathfinding algorhitms in Graph theory more approachable and easier to understand. </p><h1 class="text-3xl text-orange-300">How was it made?</h1><p class="text-lg bg-muted rounded shadow shadow-orange-300 p-2"> To not go too into detail, Gridster&#39;s backend API is built in Java 21 using Spring Boot.
